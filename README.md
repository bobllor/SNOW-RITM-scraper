# About the Project

SNOW RITM scraper which takes an RITM ticket number and scrapes the information from the ticket, returning back information that the user can use through Selenium.

This works best with the FedEx label generator, which can use the information gathered from the scraper and generate a label quickly with just an RITM ticket number.

<font color="red">***WARNING:***</font> This is tested on a company-specific instance of Service Now. It is currently unknown if other instances will work the same way.

## Getting Started
